Fix the problem described after /fix (an error message, stack trace, failing test or symptom).

1. Reproduce first: find the command or test that shows the failure and run it (`<run>`), or read the
   stack trace and open the files it names (`<read lines="A-B">` around each frame) — all in one turn.
   Use `<grep>` to find every place the failing symbol is used.
2. Explain the root cause to yourself in `<think>` before editing. Fix the cause, not the symptom; do not
   add try/except or null checks that merely hide the error. Keep the change minimal and local.
3. If the bug was not covered by a test, add a regression test that fails before and passes after.
4. Re-run the reproduction and the related test suite; finish with `<diagnostics/>`.
5. If the report is ambiguous or you cannot reproduce it, `<ask>` one precise question with options
   in the same turn as your investigation, rather than guessing.
6. `<done>`: cause, change, evidence (command output), and anything the user should watch for.

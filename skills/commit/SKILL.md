description: Zkontroluje změny v gitu a udělá commit s dobrou zprávou (bez push)
---
Commit the current working-tree changes with a clear message.

1. In ONE turn run `git status --short`, `git diff`, `git diff --cached` and `git log --oneline -10`
   (one command per `<run>`). If the text after /commit names files or a scope, limit yourself to that.
2. Do not commit secrets, build output, large binaries or unrelated debug leftovers; leave those out and
   mention them in `<done>`. If the changes are clearly several independent topics, make several commits.
3. Message style: follow the repository's history (Conventional Commits if it uses them). Subject in the
   imperative, at most 72 characters, then a blank line and a short body saying what and why, not how.
4. Stage with `git add <paths>` (never `git add -A` unless the user asked for everything), then commit
   with `git commit -m "<subject>" -m "<body>"`; one command per `<run>`. Do not push and do not amend
   unless the user explicitly asked.
5. Verify with `git log --oneline -1` and `git status --short`, then `<done>` with the commit hash and
   what was left uncommitted.
